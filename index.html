        <h1>Physically Based Fur Rendering</h1>
        <p>Visualizing different fur rendering techniques such as Marschner (2003) model and the Yan (2015) model and comparing rendering speed and quality. </br> Team: Ja Wattanawong, Briana Zhang, Richard Liu, Yi Liu</p>

      <h1>1. Mitsuba</h1><hr/>
      <p>We first worked on getting Mitsuba to work. We found that Mitsuba 2.0 no longer implemented rendering of hair and would require complicated steps to implement. Thus we switched over to Mitsuba 0.5 as it still implemented hair. In order to build the older version of Mitsuba, we had to make several changes to the build configuration files. This included porting them over to Python 3 and rewriting the files to link the Qt libraries correctly on Linux. </p>
      <p>While in the end we were able to run Mitsuba, we found that the GUI crashes on Ubuntu and Mac but was successfully able to convert the scene.xml files that described the layout and meshes of the objects to 0.6, which allows Mitsuba to render the objects and save the result as a png file. </p>
      
      <h1>2. Basic Mirror BSDF</h1><hr/>
      <p>We implemented a basic BSDF in Mitsuba in order to get more familiar with the structure of how BSDFs are implemented in Mitsuba. The BSDFs shared similar methods.</p>
      <p>The mirror BSDF has only spectral reflection without diffuse, thus providing a mirror-like surface to the object. We also set roughness to 0 and experimented with different reflection patterns such as glossy and EDiscrete which resulted in different “blurriness” of the reflection. </p>

      <h1>3. Kajiya-Kay Hair Shading Model</h1><hr/>
      <p>We worked on implementing Kajiya-Kay first since we only had to adapt the specular term. </p>

      <h1>4. Getting an Understanding of the Marschner Model</h1><hr/>
      <p>We spent a fair bit of time reading the literature behind the Marschner model, and gained a complete understanding of the intuition and mathematics of the BCSDF. This will be key as we look into implementation details and accelerations that may be necessary.</p>
  
      <h1>5. Next Steps</h1><hr/>
      <p>The Mitsuba simulator definitely took a bit longer to set up than we liked, taking up most of our first and second week. We’re hoping to wrap up the Marschner model in the next few days and start the Yan model before the end of this week. Hopefully we’ll finish everything on time and have time to set up our presentation before next Thursday. </p>
      <p>Compared with our original plan, we are currently behind by just a little bit due to unexpected issues. However, we’ve managed to solve most of these issues and are focused fully on implementing the models.</p>
