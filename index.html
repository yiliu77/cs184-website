        <h1>Physically Based Fur Rendering</h1>
        <p>Visualizing different fur rendering techniques such as Marschner (2003) model and the Yan (2015) model and comparing rendering speed and quality. </br> Team: Ja Wattanawong, Briana Zhang, Richard Liu, Yi Liu</p>

      <h1>1. Mitsuba</h1><hr/>
      <p>We first worked on getting Mitsuba to work. We found that Mitsuba 2.0 no longer implemented rendering of hair and would require complicated steps to implement. 
        Thus we switched over to Mitsuba 0.5 as it still implemented hair. In order to build the older version of Mitsuba, we utilized scons with a custom
        setup process for both Mac and Ubuntu in order to build Mitsuba.</p>
      <p>While in the end we were able to run Mitsuba, we found that the GUI crashes on Ubuntu and Mac but was successfully able to convert the scene.xml files
        that described the layout and meshes of the objects to 0.6, which allows Mitsuba to render the objects and save the result as a png file. </p>
      <h1>2. Basic BSDF</h1><hr/>
      <p>We implemented a basic BSDF in Mitsuba</p>
